John Clayton Mayer is an American singer, songwriter, 
guitarist, and record producer. Born in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut, Mayer attended Berklee College of 
Music in Boston, but disenrolled and 
moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, 
they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. 
After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, 
refining his skills and gaining a following. 


After his appearance at a 2001 South by Southwest Festival, 
he was signed to Aware Records, and eventually 
to Columbia Records, which released his first extended 
play Inside Wants Out. His following two studio albums—Room 
for Squares and Heavier Things—performed well commercially, 
achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won 
the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance 
for his single "Your Body Is a Wonderland".
